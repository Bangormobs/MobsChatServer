This application requires "mysql-connector-java" and is tested with version "3.1.14-bin".
Included in the source code are two other projects/libraries which I did not write. PIRC(IRC bot) and JSON(used for config and web interface) 

This should be run as an application from command line and as such has no graphical interface.
